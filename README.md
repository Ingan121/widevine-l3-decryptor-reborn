# Widevine L3 Decryptor Reborn
* Some shit that I made in the past, don't even exactly remember how to set it up.
* You'd better use something better and maintained, like [wvg](https://github.com/FoxRefire/wvg), which basically does the same thing, even without external software.
* To use, run the GetWVKeys server in the `Server` directory, install the extension, and then play the protected video.
* The server is based on [GetWVKeys](https://github.com/GetWVKeys/getwvkeys/tree/main/getwvkeys), and the extension is based on [widevine-l3-decryptor](https://github.com/tbodt/widevine-l3-decryptor)
